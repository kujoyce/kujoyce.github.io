            <li><p> Being a cook is my favorite hobbies. Cooking is my thearpy to me it always calms me dow espeacially if I had stressful days a work. One day I do inspire to have my on resturant but i would like to start small like a food truck. </p></li>
             <li> <p> I started my hobby as a cook when I was 19 years old in 2019 or 18 and the very first thing i made were Jamaican beef patties. My favorite cuisine is Carribean food because of their mixture of culture between african, indian and hispanic people. The food are generally sweet savory and spicy and the food is pretty healthy and they are big on getting their food locally. </p></li>
        </ul>

             <li> I don't detail other people cars i just detail my own car which is a Mazda 3 Isport I do the most to take care of because i worked really hard to pay off in 2020 when i got a highing paying job with good overtime. </li>
             <li> The things I detail on my car is any scratches i get from debris that hit my car while on the road, weekly weekend car wash i do right in the front of my garage, and cleaning the inside of my car which i vacuum and wipe down my windshields and other things in my car.</li>
        </ul>

            <img src="C:\Users\kuron\Downloads\erik-mclean-qgInQSplXBU-unsplash.jpg" alt="gamer"> 
            <li> Playing video games is my last hobby because it's the hobby that i least take part of because i use video games a reward so i do get destracted what suppose to be doing like my school work.</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h4>Target Warehouse</h4>

        <ul>
            <li> Target is my Current and third job i ever had and its pretty good. For people tht look at reviews and get discouraged to sign up for target i general tell them its just like other warehouses there pros and also cons its not that bad of a place to work. Just a job if you have good attendence and hit your daily goals your boss will leave you alone, get reliable hours, pto, insurance, and they try to create more opportunties for more leadership roles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Trainer</h4>
        
            <ul>
                    <li> I've been a trainer basically at all my jobs because I enjoy meeting and helping people and my bosses generally sees me as a good role model for newer team members. </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Meijer</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li> I worked in the gorcery store in Canal Winchester, ohio i started Jan. 5th 2020. I enjoy working there all your coworkers and bosses were friendly and fun to work with the only thing that sucked about it was the pay and the amount of work the store director expect you to do in 8 hours. He expected all the trucks to be recieved and unloaded, it would be reasonable if there were 2 trucks but a lot times we get 4 trucks and two pedals and he expected us to finsh in 8 hrs also fill the milk, stock shevles, and fill water with only two 15 min breaks and the pay wages are 11.50 which is unreasonable to me thats why i only worked there 6 months and started working at target warehouse. </li>
